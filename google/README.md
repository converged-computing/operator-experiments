# Flux Operator Experiments

> On Google Cloud! ☁️

The goal of these experiments is to test the Flux Operator at small scales, meaning
taking simple workflows and comparing execution between using the [Flux Operator](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator)
and [a more native approach](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scientific-computing-examples/tree/main/fluxfw-gcp).

 - [osu-benchmarks](osu-benchmarks)
 
For all of these examples, you will need a [Google Cloud Project](https://console.cloud.google.com) and to enable the Kubernetes Engine API.
If you are running these are your personal cloud account, it's recommended to use
the [pricing calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator) before creating any resources!
