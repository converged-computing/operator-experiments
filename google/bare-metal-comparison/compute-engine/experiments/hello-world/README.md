# Hello World Flux Operator

These experiments are testing basic functionality of running experiments on GKE with
Flux. We did them because both running on Compute Engine and GKE was having issues scaling,
and this was a basic test of hostname.

 - [run1](run1): testing basic hostname on the flux operator.
