## Results

This run adds additional timing, and removes / disables the efa (for now)
because it wasn't working (reproduced three times) on AWS. We will
use this run for a set of times across the cluster sizes, distinguishing between
flux start and flux submit, but without efa networking.

**Analysis / plots TBA**
