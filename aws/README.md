# Flux Operator Experiments

> On Amazon Cloud! ☁️

The goal of these experiments is to test the Flux Operator at small scales, meaning
taking simple workflows and comparing execution between using the [Flux Operator](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator)
and [a more native approach](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scientific-computing-examples/tree/main/fluxfw-gcp).
