# Fluence Scheduler

Here we want to compare the Kubernetes Default Scheduler with [Fluence]().

## Testing

 - [run0](run0): basic testing for setup (very small scale)
 - [run1](run1): fluence scheduler is unblocked, testing canopie22 (Illegal instruction core dumped)
 - [run2](run2): Testing again and seeing how podgroup works with the Flux Operator (worked)!
