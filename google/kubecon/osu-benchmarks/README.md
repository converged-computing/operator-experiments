# OSU Benchmarks

This is the start to an experimental setup for running OSU Benchmark experiments for Kubecon America, 2023.
We will be using the Metrics Operator.

 - [run0](run0): explicitly development and figuring out/testing OSU and others.
 - [run1](run1): Focus on OSU to get sense of timings for single runs and plan experiments.
 - [run2](run2): Get times for 128 size cluster (but actually we need 130!)
 - [run3](run3): A small test run to setup the automation bit.
